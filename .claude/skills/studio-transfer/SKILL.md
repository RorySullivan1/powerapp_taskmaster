  Expert at moving canvas Power App source between Power Apps Studio (on a work machine)
  and this repo across the manual clipboard air gap — the pulled→authored→landed lifecycle
  and the code-view mechanics that make it work. Use this skill whenever the task involves
  getting Power Fx / control YAML into or out of Studio by hand: "pull the app", "paste this
  into Studio", "copy the control code", "why won't my YAML paste", "the paste created
  Gallery1_1", "how do I get App.OnStart in", "is the repo in sync with the live app",
  "log this paste", "did this land". Trigger on the mechanics of the transfer channel —
  code view (View code / Ctrl+C / Ctrl+V), the App-object formula-bar exception, paste-time
  validation, rename-and-log after paste, clipboard permission for make.powerapps.com,
  .pa.yaml vs code-view YAML, `pac canvas download`, the round-trip test. Implicit signals:
  any uncertainty about whether the repo matches the running app, a rejected paste, a control
  that landed with a suffixed name, or a request to author formulas that will later be pasted.
  Boundaries: the *content* of the formulas — delegation, column-type policy, Person patching —
  is power-fx-development; auditing authored Power Fx before a paste is the pre-paste-review
  agent; the list schema is sharepoint-list-architecture. This skill owns the *transfer
  channel and its discipline*, not what the code says.

# Studio Transfer Skill

You move canvas-app source across a **manual clipboard air gap**: Power Apps Studio runs on
a work machine; this repo lives on a personal machine; there is no connector, MCP server,
tenant auth, CI, or linter between them. **The only channel is the clipboard, moved by a
human, one paste at a time — and it runs ONE WAY: repo → Studio.** Nothing comes back but the
human's binary "it worked / it didn't." Your job is to make each crossing deliberate, small
enough to diagnose, and recorded — the repo is the **authoritative source**, not a mirror of a
Studio you cannot query. Lead with the mechanics that matter for *this* crossing.

## Core principles (these are rules)

1. **The gap is ONE-WAY: repo → Studio. The repo is the authoritative source; Studio is the
   downstream apply-target.** Authored source flows out (a human pastes it); **nothing comes
   back** — no pull, no export, no code-view sample. The only return signal is the human's
   binary **"it works / it doesn't."** Anything edited directly in Studio is invisible drift,
   lost to the repo forever — so author here and treat these files as the truth.
2. **No round-trip, so resolve unknowns yourself — don't defer to a pull that can't happen.**
   Unknown paste tokens or dialect can't be confirmed by a returned sample. Resolve them from
   **public sources** (MS Learn, the `microsoft/PowerApps-Tooling` repo, public `.msapp`
   exports), or ship a **grounded fallback**. A wrong guess is a failed manual paste the human
   reports only as "didn't work," after which you revise blind — so **maximise first-try
   correctness** and prefer grounded constructs over nicer-but-unverified ones.
3. **Every paste costs human effort.** Few large *correct* pastes beat many small
   speculative ones. Get the formula right (and audited — see the pre-paste-review agent)
   *before* asking a human to paste it.
4. **Studio's paste-time validation is the only check that exists.** Keep each paste small
   enough that a rejection points at an obvious cause. A 400-line screen that won't paste
   tells you nothing; one control at a time tells you exactly what broke.
5. **Record every crossing in the paste log.** An unlogged paste is a drift you can't
   reconstruct. The log is how a future session knows what actually landed and under what name.

## No round-trip test — the channel is one-way

A round-trip test (copy a control out of Studio, commit it, paste it back) is **impossible
here**: Studio's output cannot reach the repo. Do not instruct the human to "View code and drop
the sample into `studio/pulled/`" — that assumes a return channel that does not exist.

Instead, establish paste-readiness *before* the human ever pastes:

1. **Ground every token from public sources.** Control names/versions and gallery `Variant`
   values come from the example `.msapp` already in the repo, MS Learn, or the
   `microsoft/PowerApps-Tooling` schema — not from a pull. (Version suffixes are optional;
   Studio uses the current version if omitted, so only the control *name* and `Variant` matter.)

   **An `.msapp` carries the ENUM TABLES, and that is the strongest evidence available here.**
   MS Learn documents properties like `Icon` and never lists their values. But an `.msapp` is a
   zip, and `References/Templates.json` inside it holds the enums as pipe-delimited runs:

   ```bash
   unzip -o app.msapp -d /tmp/app                       # note: backslash paths, ignore the warning
   grep -oE '[A-Za-z0-9_]+(\|[A-Za-z0-9_]+){20,}' /tmp/app/References/Templates.json
   ```

   That recovered the complete **180-value classic `Icon` enum** — from an export that had been
   sitting in this repo the whole time — and immediately exposed three invented names
   (`Icon.Back`, `Icon.Documents`, `Icon.Table`). The list lives in `tools/studio-enums.json`
   and the validator checks against it. **Check here BEFORE declaring a value ungroundable.**
2. **For anything still uncertain, author the grounded fallback**, and keep the risky-but-nicer
   variant documented as an alternative to try if the first paste is rejected.
3. **The human's feedback is binary** — "it pasted / it didn't." Design each paste so a failure
   is cheap to recover: small units, one control-group at a time, with the fallback ready.
4. **A "didn't work" can be a STALE STUDIO, not a bad paste.** Studio's editor can keep showing
   an old component definition after its properties or body have changed — the app behaves as if
   the edit never happened. **Ask for a browser refresh before believing any failure report.**
   Across a one-way gap a false negative is expensive: it looks like an authoring bug, and the
   revise-blind loop that follows rewrites correct code. Confirmed 2026-08-04, after two rounds
   of rewriting `cmpToast` chasing a symptom that a refresh cleared.

## The auto-layout container — GROUNDED 2026-08-04

`GroupContainer@1.5.0` with `Variant: AutoLayout`, read straight off a photo of Studio's code
view. This is the control the Insert pane calls *Horizontal container* / *Vertical container* —
one control, direction chosen by a property.

```yaml
- Container3:
    Control: GroupContainer@1.5.0
    Variant: AutoLayout
    Properties:
      LayoutDirection:  =LayoutDirection.Horizontal    # or .Vertical
      LayoutAlignItems: =LayoutAlignItems.Center
      PaddingTop: =8
      PaddingBottom: =8
      PaddingLeft: =8
      PaddingRight: =8
    Children:
      - Rectangle2:
          Control: Rectangle@2.3.0
          Properties:
            LayoutMinWidth:  =16      # child-side layout properties
            LayoutMinHeight: =16
```

**Children carry no X/Y** — the container positions them. Reach for it because it expresses
intent (a row, a stack, a gap) and re-flows siblings when a child is inserted, not to dodge any
paste hazard: layout formulas cross the gap live (see below).

**A SCROLLING COLUMN — every property below confirmed from a second code-view photo:**

```yaml
- frmScroll:
    Control: GroupContainer@1.5.0
    Variant: AutoLayout
    Properties:
      LayoutDirection:  =LayoutDirection.Vertical
      LayoutAlignItems: =LayoutAlignItems.Center
      LayoutGap:        =8
      LayoutOverflowX:  =LayoutOverflow.Scroll
      LayoutOverflowY:  =LayoutOverflow.Scroll
      PaddingTop: =8   PaddingBottom: =8   PaddingLeft: =8   PaddingRight: =8
```

Still inferred (never non-default in either photo, so Studio never printed them):
`LayoutJustifyContent`, `LayoutWrap`, `FillPortions`.

**A hidden child takes no space**, so a results gallery placed inline after its search box
expands the column when it opens and collapses when it closes — no overlay, no z-order, no
one-picker-at-a-time gate. In a scrolling form that replaces the whole absolute-overlay pattern.

## LAYOUT FORMULAS DO NOT SURVIVE THE PASTE

First-party, from *Create responsive layouts in canvas apps*:

> After you write formulas for the **X**, **Y**, **Width** and **Height** properties of a control,
> your formulas will be overwritten with constant values if you subsequently drag the control in
> the canvas editor.

**That says DRAGGING, and this section used to read it as pasting.** The two were settled apart
by experiment — `tests/scrProbe-layout-freeze.pa.yaml`, run in Studio 2026-08-13. Layout formulas
cross the gap **live**: `Parent` arithmetic, references to a control declared earlier, references
to one declared later, and a container's own `Width` all kept recomputing after the paste. A drag,
run as the control in the same session, froze on contact.

What follows from the corrected reading:

1. **Positioning off another control is allowed** and stays live. The `Y=193` gallery that this
   section used to blame on freezing was almost certainly the **name suffix**: if a control lands
   as `txtProjSearch_1`, every reference to `txtProjSearch` in that paste resolves to the old
   control or to nothing. Deleting a screen before pasting it back — this project's practice —
   avoids it.
2. **The landed app is responsive to the extent it is authored to be.** `Width: =Parent.Width - 48`
   stays that formula, and a `Theme.Space.*` change propagates on the next OnStart run.
3. **Tell the human not to DRAG a control whose geometry is a formula.** That is the one action
   that silently replaces the formula with the number it happened to be at.

**Authoring rule:** plain integers are still fine where a value is static anyway — they are
simpler to read and to check against the band table. Use a formula wherever the relationship is
the point; it will survive.

## Refinement: don't re-paste a screen to change a property (2026-08-05)

The app is BUILT — every screen populated, components in, lists added, `App.Formulas` in. Getting
source across is a **hybrid**: screens paste through code view, `App.Formulas` goes through the
formula bar (the App object has no code view), and a component's **custom properties** are typed
by hand while its controls paste.

Once a screen exists, **re-pasting it to change a few properties is the wrong move**:

- it re-suffixes any control whose name now collides (`galProjects` → `galProjects_1`), and
- it creates a second control rather than patching the first — paste is never an in-place edit.

So for a small change, name the control and the property and let the human set it in the formula
bar. Give the formula **without the leading `=`** — pa-yaml stores it with one, but the formula
bar renders that `=` outside the editable area, so pasting it yields `==` and an error that reads
like a syntax fault in the formula.

**Whole-file paste stays right for a NEW screen or a full rebuild.** Pick by what already exists
in Studio, not by habit.

## The channel — code view mechanics

Code view (GA **17 Mar 2025**) is the interactive channel. Grounded on Microsoft Learn
*Use code view for canvas app controls*:

- **Turn on the Power Fx formula bar** (app **Settings**) or View code isn't available.
- **Pull:** right-click a control (tree view or canvas) → **View code**; copy via the menu,
  **Ctrl+C**, or the **Copy code** button. Code view shows the selected control **and all its
  child controls** — copying a container brings its subtree.
- **Land:** paste via the menu or **Ctrl+V**. Pasting **creates a new control** after
  validation — it is **never** an in-place patch. Use the exact **YAML Studio generated**;
  it is validated before the control is created, so hand-edited shapes get rejected.
- **Paste assigns a suffixed name** (`Gallery1` → `Gallery1_1`). **Rename immediately** to the
  intended name and **log both** the intended name and the suffix Studio gave, so the next
  pull reconciles.
- **Browser clipboard permission** is required. The first paste prompts; if it fails, allow
  **`https://make.powerapps.com`** for clipboard access in the browser (Edge: add it to the
  allowed sites).

### Two hard limitations — design around them (official *Known limitations*)

- **The App Object has no code view.** `App.OnStart`, `App.Formulas`, and named formulas
  **cannot** be copied or pasted through code view. They go through the **formula bar only** —
  paste the body into the formula bar by hand. Treat App-level code as a separate,
  formula-bar-only transfer path, tracked in `src/`, not `studio/pulled/`.
- **The code-view pane is not editable.** You cannot edit code inside code view — pasting
  creates, it never patches. To change a control, author the new YAML here, paste to create,
  rename, and delete the old one (or patch its properties in the formula bar).

## Two artifacts, one is read-only — don't confuse them

There are two YAML surfaces and they are **not** interchangeable. Grounded on Microsoft Learn
*View source code files for canvas apps* and *Source control for canvas apps*:

| Surface | What it is | Can you paste it into Studio? |
|---|---|---|
| **Code-view YAML** | What **View code / Copy code / Paste code** produce and consume, interactively, per control | **Yes** — this is the interactive create channel. Use Studio's own output verbatim. |
| **`*.pa.yaml` source** | The single **active** source-control schema, in the `\Src` of an exported `.msapp` (or a Git-integration repo). **Read-only** — "not used when an app is loading"; changes to the file are ignored/lost. Editing, merging, conflict resolution supported **only in Power Platform Git Integration**, and only after you **publish**. | **No** — it's a *review* artifact, not a paste source. Don't try to paste `.pa.yaml` through code view. |

Consequences for this repo:
- The **code-view dialect** is what you author toward for control paste. Ground it from the
  example `.msapp` in `/example`, MS Learn, or the `microsoft/PowerApps-Tooling` schema — **not**
  from a pull (there is none). The modern versioned form (`Control: Type@version`) is what
  current Studio uses; the retired `pac canvas unpack` inline (`Name As type:`) format is **not**
  the target — do not author to it.
- The `\Src\*.pa.yaml` inside an exported `.msapp` is a useful **read-only reference** for
  *reasoning* about a whole app (that's how `/example` was mined), but it is **not** a paste
  source and, crucially, **you never receive one from the work machine** — so it's only ever a
  public sample you bring in, not the live app's state.

## The authored → landed lifecycle

1. **Authored** (`src/Screens/`, `src/`) — the change, written here in the paste
   dialect. The repo is the source of record. Formula *content* follows `power-fx-development`;
   App-level bodies go to `src/` for the formula bar.
2. **Audited** — run the **pre-paste-review agent** on the authored change. It returns a
   paste / do-not-paste verdict. Do not hand a human a paste that hasn't passed.
3. **Landed** — a human pastes it into Studio; it validates and creates the control; they
   rename it and tell you **whether it worked** (the only signal that returns). You **record the
   crossing** (date, target, intended name, Studio's suffix, outcome) in the paste log. Only now
   is it real.

There is no "pulled" stage before and no "reconciled" stage after — nothing flows back. An
authored file that has not landed is **not** in the app. Studio-only edits are drift you will
never see; never describe the app as if authored-but-unlanded work is live.

## Watch Out

1. **Waiting on a pull/round-trip that can't happen.** Nothing returns from Studio but a binary
   "worked/didn't." Don't defer a decision to "confirm on the next pull" — resolve it from public
   sources or ship a fallback now.
2. **Big speculative pastes.** A large paste that Studio rejects wastes a human's effort and
   hides the cause — and you only learn "it didn't work." Author small, audited units; let
   validation point at one thing; keep a fallback ready.
3. **Forgetting the App-object exception.** Trying to paste `App.OnStart` through code view
   fails silently to exist — there's no App code view. It's formula-bar-only.
4. **Losing the rename.** Paste names collide-suffix (`_1`). If you don't rename and log
   immediately, the next pull is full of `Control_1` noise you can't map back.
5. **Pasting `.pa.yaml`.** It's read-only review output, not a paste source. Imitate the
   **code-view** dialect for anything you intend to land.
6. **Rewriting code on an unrefreshed failure report.** Before diagnosing, confirm Studio was
   refreshed after the edit. A stale editor reports a working unit as broken, and each blind
   rewrite that follows costs a full round trip and can damage code that was already correct.

## Out of scope — defer

- **Formula *content*** — delegation, column-type policy, Person/Claims patching, aggregation
  rules → **power-fx-development** (matrix in its `delegation.md`).
- **Auditing an authored change before paste** (non-delegable expressions, schema violations,
  paste/do-not-paste verdict) → the **pre-paste-review** agent.
- **The list schema and internal names** the formulas bind to → **sharepoint-list-architecture**
  and the `schema` context brief.
- **Orchestrating a whole change** (freshness → author → audit → hand off → record) → the
  **change-end-to-end** workflow, which invokes this skill for the transfer steps.

## App.OnStart / App.Formulas: the comment trap (2026-08-12)

Both properties cross the gap through the **formula bar**, and both fail totally: everything lives
in a single property, so **one rejection of `App.OnStart` takes out `gTheme`, `gNavMenu`,
`gStageWeights` and `gClaimPrefix` together.** Every screen then reads blank for every colour and
every `gTheme.Space.*` dimension — blank coerces to 0 — and the app renders **squished and black**.
That symptom is not a layout bug and not a theme bug; it is "App.OnStart set nothing."
`App.Formulas` fails the same way, but its blast radius is the three data-source filters
(`ActiveProjects`, `OpenIssues`, `LiveTasks`), which read as empty galleries rather than black.

Two ways the paste fails, both silent-ish:

1. **The leading `=`.** It is the pa-yaml marker, not part of the formula. The formula bar renders
   its own `=` outside the editable area, so pasting ours yields `==` and an error that reads like
   a syntax fault in the first statement.
2. **`//` runs to end of line.** A **collapsed** formula bar flattens multi-line paste into one
   line — and our body OPENS with a comment, so the first `//` swallows the entire property.
   Nothing is defined, and there is no error to see because a comment is valid.

**EXPAND the formula bar before pasting.** And when in doubt, paste code with no comments at all:

    python3 tools/formula_bar_body.py onstart  --bare
    python3 tools/formula_bar_body.py formulas --bare

The reasoning belongs in the repo, which is the authoritative source; Studio only needs the code.
Stripping the comments for transfer loses nothing and removes the failure mode entirely.

**The decisive diagnostic**, because "it didn't work" cannot localise a long property: run OnStart
(App → Run OnStart), then type `gTheme.` into any control's `Fill`. If IntelliSense does not offer
the members, `App.OnStart` set nothing — go back to the property itself and check whether it is one
long line or starts with a stray `=`. App checker (Advanced tools) lists the error app-wide.
